\title{Finding differentially expressed unannotated genomic regions from
RNA-seq data}
\description{
\code{srnadiff} is a package that finds differently expressed regions
from RNA-seq data at \emph{base-resolution} level without relying on
existing annotation. To do so, the package implements the
\emph{identify-then-annotate} methodology that builds on the idea of
combining two pipelines approach: differential expressed regions detection
and differential expression quantification.
}
\details{
The \code{srnadiff} package implements two major methods to produce
potential differentially expressed regions: the HMM and Slice method.
Briefly, these methods identify contiguous base-pairs in the genome
that present differential expression signal, then these are regrouped
into genomic intervals called differentially expressed regions (DERs).

Once DERs are detected, the second step in a sRNA-diff approach is to
quantify the statistic signification of these. To do so, reads (including
fractions of reads) that overlap each expressed region are counted to
arrive at a count matrix with one row per region and one column per sample.
Then, this count matrix is analyzed using the standard workflow of
\code{DESeq2} for differential expression of RNA-seq data, assigning a
p-value to each candidate DER.

The main functions for finds differently expressed regions are
\code{\link{srnadiffExp}} and \code{\link{srnadiff}}. The first one
creats an S4 class providing the infrastructure (slots) to store the
input data, methods parameters, intermediate calculations and results
of an sRNA-diff approach. The second one implement four methods to find
candidate differentially expressed regions and quantify the statistic
signification of the finded regions. Details about the implemented methods
are further described in the vignette and the manual page of the
\code{\link{srnadiff}} function.

\examples{
## A typical srnadiff session might look like the following.

## Here we assume that 'bamFiles' is a vector with the full
## paths to the BAM files and the sample and experimental
## design information are stored in a data frame 'sampleInfo'.

\dontrun{

#-- Data preparation
srnaExp <- srnadiffExp(bamFiles, sampleInfo)

#-- Detecting DERs and quantifying differential expression
srnaExp <- srnadiff(srnaExp)

#-- Visualization of the results
plotRegions(srnaExp, regions(srnaExp)[1])
}
