\usage{
setTransitionProbabilities(object, noDiffToDiff, diffToNoDiff)

\S4method{setTransitionProbabilities}{sRNADiff,numeric,numeric}(object,
  noDiffToDiff, diffToNoDiff)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{srnadiff} object.}

\item{noDiffToDiff}{probability to change from the "not-differentially
expressed" state to the "differentially expressed"
state}

\item{diffToNoDiff}{probability to change from the "differentially
expressed" state to the "not-differentially expressed"
state}
}
\value{
The same object
}
\description{
The second parameter gives the probability to go from a not-differentially
expressed state to a differentially expressed state.
The third parameter gives the probability to go from a differentially
expressed state to a not-differentially expressed state.
These parameters effectively shape the expected sizes of the sRNAs in the HMM
step.
